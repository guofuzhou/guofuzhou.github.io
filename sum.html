              <li>
        Rapach,    Strauss and Zhou (2013)  is perhaps  the   <span style="color: blue"><i>first</i> </span>        academic study (published in a top finance journal)
          that  applies  LASSO (a popular machine learning tool)  in finance. They use it to   select predictors from
            a large set  of  candidates, "big-data",   for forecasting stock markets globally.  </li>
               </li>
                <li>  Jiang, Tang and Zhou (2018)  study  firm characteristics in China, via   “big-data”  methods such as   PCA and PLS,
                 and find that  trading frictions, momentum, and profitability are the most effective predictors of future stock returns.  </li>
            <li> Rapach,   Strauss Tu, and Zhou (2019), superseding an early 2014 version,
                    apply Lasso to forecast industry returns
         with their lagged values, and find information diffusion may be responsible for the significant predictability.   </li>
               </li>
              <li>  Jiang, Lee, Martin and Zhou (2019) apply textual analysis to construct   a manager    sentiment   index  from firm tone of conference calls and financial statements  ("big-data"). They find that manager sentiment   drives both  firm aggregate investments  and market returns.
               </li>
                <li>   Rapach and Zhou (2020) apply the new cross sectional ML methods of Han, He, Rapach and Zhou (2020) to time series forecasting, and find they deliver the best empirical results compared with the currently   most effective ones.
               </li>
                 <li>  Detzel, Liu, Strauss, Zhou and Zhu  (2021) propose perhaps the <i>  first </i>   equilibrium model that shows how technical analysis can arise  endogenously via rational learning,  providing
                       a theoretical foundation of using technical analysis  in practice.
   They document   that ratios of prices to their moving averages forecast daily Bitcoin returns in- and out-of sample, and similar results hold for small-cap, young-firm, and low-analyst-coverage stocks as well as NASDAQ stocks during the dotcom era.
               </li>
   <li>   Huang, Jiang, Li, Tong and Zhou (2021) propose a s-PCA, a new modification of the popular principal component analysis (PCA) by scaling each predictor
    with its predictive slope on the target to be forecasted to increase the predictive power of the extracted factor.
               </li>
                 <li> Dong, Li, Rapach and Zhou (2022) show, via machine learning methods, that
                  cross section    anomalies are important predictors of the US stock market returns, linking  cross-section and time series predictability
                   and useful to index managers who even do not trade firm factors.    </li>
                   <li> He, Huang, Li and  Zhou (2022)
                   provide a reduced-rank approach (RRA) to extract a few factors from a large set of factor proxies
                  to explain expected returns, outperforming  PCA, PLS and LASSO.
                      </li>
                      <li>   Guo,   Lin, Wu and Zhou (2022)  find, via  both traditional and   machine learning tools,    strong evidence of cross-sectional predictability of corporate bonds  by  yield predictors that capture the info of past 1, 3, and up to 48 months.
                      </li>
                      <li> Chen, Guo and  Zhou (2022)   identify, via    machine learning tools,
                        firm fundamentals  that explain  the shape of the option implied volatility   curve, providing insights into
                           some puzzling patterns in the options literature.
                      </li>
                       <li>  Rapach and  Zhou (2022) provide a survey of studies on time series predictability, with various recent
                        methods  including   machine-learning-based ones.

                      Huang, Jiang, Li, Tong and Zhou (2023) propose a  scaled sufficient forecasting (sSUFF) method to account for the nonlinearity and weak
factors, showing that bond returns are predictable by real-time macro variables.

                         <li>   He and Zhou (2023)  is perhaps  the   <span style="color: blue"><i>first</i> </span>   study
         on the predictability of  pricing errors,  which provides a powerful test  for asset pricing models,  rejecting

  <LI> <B href="#"> CAPM,  APT and Factor models </B>: </LI>
      <UL>
    <li>Harvey and Zhou (1990) provide  Bayesian multivariate tests of the CAPM (The Capital Asset Pricing Model) and find  the probability  that the market
    is mean-variance efficient is quite small for a range of plausible priors. </li>
     <li> Zhou (1991) provides the <i>  first </i> exact test of the zero-beta CAPM which allows
   for borrowing rates be higher than the lending rates (more complex than the usual CAPM, but more realistic) and finds even this extension will not explain the market inefficiency. </li>
    <li> Zhou (1993) provides  a finite sample test of the  CAPM, with the exact  P-value
     computed via simulations without unknown parameters
     for elliptical data, including in particular normal and t-distributions.
     </li>
      <li> Harvey and Zhou (1993) provide GMM tests of the  CAPM,  which is robust to general distributions.
     </li>
      <li> Geweke and Zhou (1994) provide  an exact Bayesian framework for analyzing the arbitrage pricing theory (APT) and find the pricing errors
    are  little changed with including more factors beyond the first one (the pricing errors there may be better  weighted by
      using the asset inverse covariance matrix so that they will be invariant to portfolio  repackaging).</li>
       <li>  Chou and Zhou (2006) provide bootstrap tests of the  CAPM,  which is robust to  iid distributions and more accurate
        than usual asymptotic tests.
     </li>
      <li>  Kan and Zhou (2017) provide asymptotic tests the  CAPM under t-distributions,  in which the
       parameter estimates are efficiently obtained by using the EM-algorithm rather than the standard inefficient  OLS estimator.
     </li>
       <li> He, Huang, Li and  Zhou (2022)
                   provide a reduced-rank approach (RRA) to extract a few factors from a large set of factor proxies

     </li>
      <li>  Chib, Zhao and Zhou (2024) identify, via  Bayesian model scanning, a set of  new  factors out of
      a large set  well  known ones    plus    twelve principal components of anomalies unexplained by the existing ones.
     </li>
     <li>   Liu, Zhou and Zhu (2023)  propose a 4-factor model, with a

<UL>
   <LI>  <B>   FOMC and Other Announcements      </B>:

    <li>  Liu, Tang and Zhou (2022)   propose a novel method to recover the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  risk premium and drift sizes:
        the  risk premium varies   from 1 to 326  bps,  upward drift   is 101 bps, and  downward drift   129 bps. </li>

                 <UL>
                      <li> Zhou (1994) provides  the <i>  first </i> GMM tests for patterned weighting matrices that allow  analytically solutions
      in many finance applications (cited by Matyas  (1999) in his GMM book; Cochrane  (2001) presents a similar GMM test   in his asset pricing book).

 <UL>
     <LI>  <B> SDF </B>:
     <UL>
    <li> Kan and Zhou (1999) show that the usual SDF (stochastic discount factor) approach provides unreliable risk premium estimate,
       later studies resolve this problem by  adding factor moment conditions  for which no more analytical solutions available. </li>
        <li>  Kan and Zhou (2006) provide the tightest lower bound on the SDF to date,    showing that   well known asset models  do not
           have enough volatility in the SDF to pass this bound. </li>
        <li>   He and Zhou (2023) introduce the idea of testing pricing error predictability including those from a general SDF, based which they reject the   well known asset pricing models and well as  those recently developed based on machine learning.

       Shanken and Zhou (2007)  provide formal model misppecification tests in addition to   a comprehensive theoretical and small sample study of the widely used Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass procedure that is fundamental in understanding to what extent cross-sectional expected returns/values are explained by certain factor attributes.
              <li>  Jagannathan, Schaumburg and Zhou (2010) provide a survey of the literature on the two-pass procedure. </li>
              <li>  Bai and Zhou (2015)  provide both the asymptotic theory for   Fama and MacBeth (1973)
 two-pass  regressions   and    new biased-adjusted OLS and GLS estimators in the common N>T case. </li>

           <UL>
    <li> Lamoureux and Zhou (1996) show that the market is a random walk if no conditional information is incorporated. </li>
             <li>  Rapach and   Strauss and Zhou (2010) provide the <i>  first </i> empirical evidence that:  the US market risk premium is consistently predictable out-of-sample,  with macroeconomic  predictors via a combination forecast approach. </li>
              <li>   Zhou (2010)  provides a theoretical  upper bound on the degree of predictability, improving substantially  Ross   bound  implied by   asset pricing models when state  variables are available. </li>
             <li> Kong,   Rapach,   Strauss  and   Zhou (2011)
                 analyze the predictability of market components. </li>
                   <li>  Rapach and   Strauss and Zhou (2013) find that the US stock market leads the world markets even at the monthly frequency. </li>
                  <li>  Rapach and Zhou (2013) provide a survey of the literature on stock return predictability. </li>
           <li>  Neely,  Rapach, Tu  and Zhou (2014) show further that the predictive power of  technical indicators
              matches  or exceeds  that of macroeconomic variables (note that technical indicators, such as moving averages of prices, can capture
                fundamental information too, such as world political stability, that are reflected in prices and not yet reflected in common macro variables).

                       <li> Huang and Zhou (2017) provide substantially tighter bounds on predictability and find major
                     asset pricing models  fail to explain observed  predictability   due to inadequate state variables. </li>
                    <li>  Lin, Wu  and Zhou (2018) provide a new iterated combination forecast method (of which the PLS is a special case), and, with this new method, they find the predictability of corporate bonds is both economically and statistically significant.
                    <li>   Gao,   Han,  Li and Zhou (2018) discover   an    intraday  predictive  pattern: the first half-hour return on the market predicts the last half-hour return. </li>
                      <li> Jiang, Lee, Martin and Zhou (2019)   find that a new manager sentiment index predicts strongly  aggregate investments  and market returns.
       </li>
        <li>   Huang,  Li, Wang and  Zhou (2019) show that   time-series momentum (TSM),
           the predictability of the past 12-month return on the next one-month
return,   is   quite   weak for the large cross
section of assets,    altering conclusion of  the literature.

                 <UL>
    <li> Zhu and Zhou (2009)  provide perhaps the <i>  first </i> theoretical study  to show  that technical analysis, specifically the widely used moving averages,
            can add value to asset allocation  under  uncertainty about predictability or
               uncertainty about the true model governing the stock price.    </li>
             <li> Zhou, Zhu and Qian  (2012)  provide  an optimal asset
allocation strategy  using technical indictors.   </li>
    <li> Han and Yang and Zhou (2013) find that  technical analysis, applied to   portfolios sorted by volatility or other info
                proxies, can  outperform the buy-and-hold strategy substantially, and yield  abnormal returns over 20% annually, which  cannot be explained by market timing ability, investor sentiment, default and liquidity risks. </li>
           <li>      Olszweski and Zhou (2014) show that combining  both technicals and macro/fundamentals  offers a significant improvement in risk-adjusted returns. </li>
    <li> Han, Zhou and Zhu (2016) provide perhaps the <i>  first </i>  general equilibrium model on moving averages  to justify their  predictability, and to understand the role of technical traders;
                   they also    propose   a trend factor to
    capture  simultaneously all three stock price trends (the short-, intermediate- and long-term), which   outperforms  substantially existing factors, such as the momentum, by  more than doubling their Sharpe ratios.

With the extension, the new model   not only is consistent with the volatility literature that the stock market is driven by two, rather than one, volatility factors, but also provides significant improvements in  explaining various puzzles  of equity and options data.

    <li> Huang, Jiang, Tu and Zhou (2015)  provide  a new investor sentiment index that is aligned with the purpose of predicting the aggregate stock market. By eliminating a common noise component in sentiment proxies, the new index has much greater predictive power than existing sentiment indices both in- and out-of-sample,  outperforms well recognized macroeconomic variables and can also predict cross-sectional stock returns sorted by industry, size, value, and momentum.
       </li>
        <li>  Zhou (2018)   provides a  review on     various measures
of investor sentiment based on
 market, survey, and media data, respectively, and
  discusses  various  potential extensions and a number of issues for
  future research.
       </li>
           <li> Jiang, Lee, Martin and Zhou (2019)  provide  a manager    sentiment   index based on the aggregated textual tone of conference calls and financial statements. They find that manager sentiment   differs from investor sentiment in driving firm aggregate investments  and market returns.
       </li>
       <li>  Chen,  Tang,  Yao and Zhou (2020) propose an investor attention index, and find it has strong  predictive power on the stock market due to  perhaps  the reversal of temporary price pressure.
 </li>
     <li>  Chen,  Tang,  Yao and Zhou (2023) propose an employee sentiment   index, and find it has strong  predictive power on the stock market, as    high employee sentiment leads to high contemporaneous wage growth  resulting in lower firm cash flow and lower stock returns.

    <li> Jiang,   Rapach,   Strauss, Tu and Zhou (2011) find that the Chinese stock market is twice as predictable as the US. </li>
     <li> Fan,  Li and Zhou (2013) analyze its supply factor  in the Chinese bond market. </li>
              <li>  Han, Wang, Zhou and Zou (2014) show momentum exists in China, but on a short-term basis only. </li>
                       <li>   Fan,  Jiang and Zhou (2014)  provide an overview   of the Chinese bond market.

         <li>      Jiang, Tang and Zhou (2018) provide perhaps the <i>  first </i> comprehensive analysis,
          perhaps the   <i>  first </i>  machine learning study too, of  firm characteristics on explaining Chinese stock expected returns in the cross section, and
          find that   trading frictions, momentum, and profitability have strong  forecasting power in China.
       </li>
          <li>      Wang, Zhou and Zhu (2021) provide an option pricing  model  accounting for short-selling and margin-trading constraints, and show that
            Chinese warrant prices, save for the time around expiration dates, are better characterized as derivatives than as pure bubbles.
       </li>
       <li>   Liu, Zhou and Zhu (2023)  propose a 4-factor model, with a
trend factor   that  highlights the important role of individual
trading in asset pricing, especially in China.
